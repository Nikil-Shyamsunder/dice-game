If you ever need to break a tie between two options, simply use this web application to make your choice! Each time you reload the page or click the re-roll button, it will simulate a 6-sided dice roll and tell you the winner. 
This is a Random Dice Game generator using only HTML/CSS/JS. Built by scratch only by me. Inspired by a project from the London App Brewery.
